[This is a template for your project collaboration document.  Please briefly answer the following questions in whatever format you'd lik. Try to stay within 500 words unless there is an issue/bug requiring additional explanation.]

(1) Who did you collaborate with or recieve help/insight from during this project, and how did they help?

Aside from discussing the conceptual basis of the project with various peers, I spent quite some time looking back at slides, notes, and the textbook.



(2) What went well for you in this project?

I think something that went well for me in the project was looking at the code and macros provided and being able to actually write the code using them with a good understanding early on.



(3) What was challenging for you in this project?

The challenge in this project came early on for me. It was mainly in terms of conceptually understanding what I needed to do and how I would implement that in C code. The way I addressed this challenge was by spending lot of time jotting down pseudo code and basic structure on a piece of paper and understanding what I needed to do. That way when I was writing my code, I was able to do it fairly simply without many bugs because I had figured out what I needed beforehand.



(4) Did you consult any online sources in developing the code you are submitting?  Please list any sources and how/why you used them.  Note that any code or bug-fixes directly used in your code should be well-commented *by you* to indicate your understanding.

Aside from textbook and lecture notes, I did not use any other online sources.
