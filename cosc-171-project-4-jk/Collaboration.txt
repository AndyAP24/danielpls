[This is a template for your project collaboration document.  Please briefly answer the following questions in whatever format you'd like. Try to stay within 500 words unless there is an issue/bug requiring additional explanation.](1) Who did you collaborate with or receive help/insight from during this project, and how did they help? Clarified some ideas with Prof. Lilian Pentecost and Andy.(2) What went well for you in this project? I went through each function and made sure I understood it’s use in the project (took some notes on them). I also added comments to reflect my understanding of each part and print statements as necessary (they are commented out in the submission) to trace project and test certain behaviors. Some sample error I run into is that my while loop for finding victim page was not terminating as I was not writing the referenced_cleared entry back into the address before continuing to the next entry.(3) What was challenging for you in this project? The challenging part was understanding the already-presented code and also putting print statements in the right places to understand which part of the project was not working.(4) Did you consult any online sources in developing the code you are submitting?  Please list any sources and how/why you used them.  Note that any code or bug-fixes directly used in your code should be well-commented *by you* to indicate your understanding.  I used the linked pdf for the page swapping algorithm.
