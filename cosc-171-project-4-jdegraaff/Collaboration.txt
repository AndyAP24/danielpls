(1) Who did you collaborate with or recieve help/insight from during this project, and how did they help?

I checked my logic when writing pseudocode and application of logic when writing actual code with the TAs, mostly Daniel.

(2) What went well for you in this project?

Opposite from last time--while the logic was hard, the application of it wasn't too bad. I feel like once I understood what was asked of me and how to do it, I could translate from pseudocode to actual code pretty readily.

(3) What was challenging for you in this project?

Logic for sure. This was a tough lab to have the scaffolding removed on. 

(4) Did you consult any online sources in developing the code you are submitting?  Please list any sources and how/why you used them.  Note that any code or bug-fixes directly used in your code should be well-commented *by you* to indicate your understanding.

Just previous code I've written and code from this lab.
